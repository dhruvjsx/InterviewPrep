- ## The reason I created these new repositories was to implement additional privacy policies, such as <ins>disabling forking</ins>.

- ## Since you all paid for access to these repositories, it would be counterproductive if the latest notes were accessed by non-paying members.

- ## I recognized the need to address this issue and have decided to migrate everyone to a new repositories with stricter privacy policies, which I could not implement in my current repositories.

- ## I will do my utmost to ensure this repository remains accessible only to paid members, unless you decide to zip the folder and share it with friends or relatives 😁😁.
